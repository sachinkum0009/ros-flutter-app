## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically build and release the Flutter app.

### Build Process âœ…
- **On every push/PR**: Builds and tests the Flutter app
- **Modern Actions**: Uses latest GitHub Actions with caching for faster builds
- **Code Analysis**: Runs `flutter analyze` to catch potential issues
- **Artifacts**: APK files are stored as build artifacts for 30 days

### Release Process ðŸš€
- **Automatic releases**: Created when you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **APK attachment**: Release APK is automatically built and attached to GitHub releases
- **Rich release notes**: Auto-generated with emojis, installation instructions, and configuration details

### Creating a Release
To create a new release with APK:

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the release workflow, build a fresh APK, and create a GitHub release with the APK attached.

### Recent CI/CD Improvements
- ðŸ”§ **Fixed deprecated actions**: Updated to modern GitHub Actions
- âš¡ **Added caching**: Faster builds with Flutter dependency caching  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Better error handling**: Improved workflow reliability
- ðŸ“± **Enhanced release notes**: Rich formatting with installation guides
